# Volcano_Eruption_Simulation
Using MatLab

The user can input the number of projectiles and the measures of the volcano.

The program generates a random direction and magnitude for each projectile. It then calculates other values such as velocity and mass using the physical
properties of parabolic motion.

The simulation uses these properties to generate a visual image of the volcano eruption.
